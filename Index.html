Lance armstrong famously titled his book "It's not about the Bike", but since his douchebag status is now thouroughly cemented in the public conciousness, I'm going to ignore him and talk about bikes to my hearts content. Contrary to popular belief, road bikes can be set up comfortably. Usually they aren't for a number of reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ul class= "leftList">
                        <li>They are built for speed.</li>
                        <li>They are poorly fitted to their rider</li>
                        <li>They are so cheap that the design is simply copied from more agressive bikes with little thought to comfort.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your bike is worth riding, then it's worth setting up properly. look at some guides online, listen to your body before niggles turn into injuries and make small changes at all the contact points until they go away.<br /><br />Broadly speaking road bikes fit into 3 price categories:
                    </p>

                                less than £300: cheap and awful

                            <p>
                                It will sap your energy and enthusiasm without you realising it.

                            <p>
                                Reasonably cheaply repaired, slightly more prone to issues, slightly slower, but you should be able to compensate and whoop ass with training. Get some new tyres asap though.

                            <p>
                                Best balance between durability and performance for the average rider.

                            <p>
                                Trades durability and comfort for that vanishing few percent of performance. If you buy a bike in this range and can't ride at 60% for 2 hours then you sir, are a fool.
